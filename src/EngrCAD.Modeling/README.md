# EngrCAD.Modeling

The unified modeling API: build a **`Shape`** once with one vocabulary, then decide at
the end which representation it becomes:

```csharp
var body = Shape.Box(40, 30, 10) - Shape.Cylinder(4, 12).Translate(10, 8, 0);

BrepSolid exact   = body.ToBrep();       // precision modeling, STEP export
Sdf       field   = body.ToImplicit();   // blends, shells, lattices
HalfEdgeMesh mesh = body.ToMesh();       // rendering, FEA, 3D printing
scene.Add("body", body);                 // viewer picks the best route itself
```

`Shape` is an immutable operation graph (like the `Sdf` AST, but engine-neutral). Each
conversion *lowers* the graph: native operations where the target engine has them,
bridges through another representation where it doesn't, and a clear error where no
route exists. `shape.Explain(target)` reports the per-node plan without doing the work;
`CanConvertTo` is the boolean version; impossible conversions throw
`ShapeConversionException` carrying the same report.

Transforms are never applied to finished geometry when the target can do better: the
lowering accumulates the matrix and bakes it into construction inputs (profiles,
directions, axes), so a rotated-then-drilled B-Rep stays exact.

## Operation support by target

| Operation | → B-Rep | → Implicit (SDF) | → Mesh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Box` | ✅ native (extrusion if sheared) | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ native |
| `Sphere` | ✅ native (rigid + uniform scale) · ❌ sheared (ellipsoid) | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Cylinder` | ✅ native (any affine — circle becomes ellipse) | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ native |
| `Torus` | ✅ native (rigid + uniform scale) · ❌ sheared | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Extrude(Sketch)` | ✅ native | ✅ **native** (exact 2D SDF) | ✅ native |
| `Revolve(Sketch)` full turn | ✅ native (axis-touching OK: on-axis stretches become poles) | ✅ **native** (exact 2D SDF) | ✅ native |
| `Extrude` (profile, holes, shear) | ✅ native | 🔶 bridged (tessellation → mesh SDF) | ✅ native |
| `Revolve` (partial/full, holes) | ✅ native (rigid) · ❌ sheared | 🔶 bridged | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Sweep` (RMF path, holes) | ✅ native (rigid) · ❌ sheared | 🔶 bridged | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Union` / `Intersect` / `Subtract` | ✅ native (`BrepBoolean`) | ✅ native | ✅ (from B-Rep, else `MeshBoolean`) |
| `SmoothUnion` / `SmoothIntersect` / `SmoothSubtract` | ❌ no B-Rep form | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |
| `Offset` / `Shell` | ❌ no B-Rep form | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |
| `Lattice` (gyroid & co.) | ❌ no B-Rep form | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |
| `Translate` / `Rotate` / `Scale` (uniform) | ✅ baked into inputs | ✅ native SDF ops | ✅ |
| General affine (shear, non-uniform scale) | ✅ box/cylinder/extrude · ❌ others | 🔶 bridged | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `From(BrepSolid)` | ✅ (untransformed) · ❌ transformed | 🔶 bridged (mesh SDF) | ✅ tessellated |
| `From(HalfEdgeMesh)` | ❌ no mesh→B-Rep import | ✅ exact mesh SDF (closed meshes) | ✅ as-is |
| `From(Sdf)` | ❌ no SDF→B-Rep | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |

✅ native (exact for the target) · 🔶 bridged through another representation
(approximate but robust; `Explain` names the route) · ❌ impossible — the conversion
throws, with the offending node named.

Everything is convertible **to mesh**: what has no B-Rep form is polygonized from the
SDF path instead (Surface Nets), so `ToMesh`/`Scene.Add` never reject a shape.
`ToMesh` picks the highest-fidelity route per graph: whole-tree B-Rep tessellation
first (crisp edges, exact booleans), SDF polygonization when blends/offsets are
involved, per-node mesh booleans only for `From(mesh)` leaves.

## Dropping down to the engine APIs

`Shape` is a convenience layer, not a cage. When something needs an engine's full API,
exit with `ToBrep()`/`ToImplicit()`/`ToMesh()`, work directly, and re-enter with
`Shape.From(...)` — the wrapped result composes with everything else:

```csharp
// 1. Exit to B-Rep for an operation Shape doesn't surface (rim filleting):
var puck = (Shape.Cylinder(10, 4) - Shape.Cylinder(4, 6)).ToBrep();
var rim = puck.Edges.First(IsTopOuterRim);
var filleted = Filleting.FilletEdge(puck, rim, radius: 1);

// 2. Exit to the SDF AST for a custom field (any hand-written Sdf composes):
Sdf ripple = Sdf.Sphere(6).Offset(0.5 * Math.Sin(...));   // or your own Sdf subclass

// 3. Re-enter and keep modeling representation-agnostically:
var body = Shape.From(filleted)
    .SmoothUnion(Shape.From(ripple).Translate(0, 0, 6), 0.8)
    .Lattice(Sdf.Gyroid(2, 0.4));
scene.Add("hybrid", body);
```

The same works with hand-built `HalfEdgeMesh` geometry (scanned or generated meshes):
`Shape.From(mesh)` is an exact signed distance field to the mesh in implicit lowerings
and participates in mesh booleans directly. The support table above tells you which
exits are lossless for the graph you've built — `Explain(target)` tells you for a
specific shape.

## Sketching

2D sketches — lines, circular arcs, cubic/quadratic béziers — drawn with a fluent
builder or primitives, then consumed by any representation:

```csharp
var plate = Sketch.Start(-2, -1)
    .LineTo(2, -1)
    .ArcTo(new(2, 1), radius: 1.4, clockwise: false)
    .LineTo(-2, 1)
    .BezierTo(new(-3.4, 0.6), new(-3.4, -0.6), new(-2, -1))
    .Close()
    .WithHole(Sketch.Circle(new(1, 0), 0.4));

var body = Shape.Extrude(plate, 0.5);           // B-Rep: exact NURBS profile
var vase = Shape.Revolve(vaseSketch);           // implicit: exact 2D signed distance
```

Primitives: `Rectangle`, `RoundedRectangle`, `Circle`, `Polygon`, `Slot`. Sketches are
pure 2D; `Shape.Extrude/Revolve/Sweep` place them with a `SketchPlane` (`XY`/`XZ`/`YZ`
presets or `At(origin, x, y)`; revolve defaults to `XZ` so the axis is world Z, sketch
x = radius). `Area()` is exact (arc terms analytic, béziers by exact-degree Gauss
quadrature).

The payoff: a sketch knows its **exact 2D signed distance** (`ToRegion()`, composable
with `Sdf.ExtrudedRegion`/`RevolvedRegion`), so sketch-based extrusions and full
revolutions are *Native* in the implicit lowering — no mesh bridge — while B-Rep gets
exact rational arcs/béziers and mesh gets crisp tessellation. Sketches touching the
revolve axis (vases, domes) work everywhere on full turns: on-axis stretches revolve
to nothing and are dropped, their endpoints becoming B-Rep poles (partial revolves
still need axis clearance). A 2D constraint solver is future work (todo.md).

## The document model: Part, Tab, Scene

Parts carry all their own information — name, geometry from **any** engine (`Shape`,
`BrepSolid`, `HalfEdgeMesh`, or `Sdf`), color, placement — and are grouped into a
scene's named tabs, which the viewer shows as a tab strip (per-tab cameras):

```csharp
var scene = new Scene(new MeshQuality { SegmentsPerCircle = 48 });

var housing = scene.AddTab("housing");
housing.Add(new Part("body", bodyShape, Palette.Steel));
housing.Add(new Part("lid", lidSolid));            // color auto-assigned from Palette

scene.Add(new Part("jig", jigMesh));               // shorthand: default "Model" tab
```

`Part.GetMesh(quality)` produces the display mesh on first use and caches it (Shapes
via their best route, B-Reps tessellated, SDFs polygonized, meshes as-is);
`Scene.PreMesh()` does this for every part up front so viewers never tessellate on the
render thread. Part names are unique per tab. `Part` is deliberately a leaf — tabs are
the containers — so assemblies (placed instances of parts/sub-assemblies) can slot in
alongside parts later.

## Quality

Bridges and mesh output honor `MeshQuality` (`SegmentsPerCircle`, `CurveSamples` for
tessellation, `SdfResolution` for polygonization); `Scene.Options` carries the same
knobs for everything shown through a scene.

## Future work (todo.md)

Sketch constraint solver (see todo.md), mesh→B-Rep import
(unlock blends → B-Rep), fillets on `Shape` with edge selectors, ellipsoid surfaces for
non-uniformly scaled spheres.
