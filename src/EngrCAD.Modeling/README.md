# EngrCAD.Modeling

The unified modeling API: build a **`Shape`** once with one vocabulary, then decide at
the end which representation it becomes:

```csharp
var body = Shape.Box(40, 30, 10) - Shape.Cylinder(4, 12).Translate(10, 8, 0);

BrepSolid exact   = body.ToBrep();       // precision modeling, STEP export
Sdf       field   = body.ToImplicit();   // blends, shells, lattices
HalfEdgeMesh mesh = body.ToMesh();       // rendering, FEA, 3D printing
scene.Add("body", body);                 // viewer picks the best route itself
```

`Shape` is an immutable operation graph (like the `Sdf` AST, but engine-neutral). Each
conversion *lowers* the graph: native operations where the target engine has them,
bridges through another representation where it doesn't, and a clear error where no
route exists. `shape.Explain(target)` reports the per-node plan without doing the work;
`CanConvertTo` is the boolean version; impossible conversions throw
`ShapeConversionException` carrying the same report.

Transforms are never applied to finished geometry when the target can do better: the
lowering accumulates the matrix and bakes it into construction inputs (profiles,
directions, axes), so a rotated-then-drilled B-Rep stays exact.

## Operation support by target

| Operation | → B-Rep | → Implicit (SDF) | → Mesh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Box` | ✅ native (extrusion if sheared) | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ native |
| `Sphere` | ✅ native (rigid + uniform scale) · ❌ sheared (ellipsoid) | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Cylinder` | ✅ native (any affine — circle becomes ellipse) | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ native |
| `Torus` | ✅ native (rigid + uniform scale) · ❌ sheared | ✅ native · 🔶 bridged if sheared | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Extrude` (profile, holes, shear) | ✅ native | 🔶 bridged (tessellation → mesh SDF) | ✅ native |
| `Revolve` (partial/full, holes) | ✅ native (rigid) · ❌ sheared | 🔶 bridged | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Sweep` (RMF path, holes) | ✅ native (rigid) · ❌ sheared | 🔶 bridged | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `Union` / `Intersect` / `Subtract` | ✅ native (`BrepBoolean`) | ✅ native | ✅ (from B-Rep, else `MeshBoolean`) |
| `SmoothUnion` / `SmoothIntersect` / `SmoothSubtract` | ❌ no B-Rep form | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |
| `Offset` / `Shell` | ❌ no B-Rep form | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |
| `Lattice` (gyroid & co.) | ❌ no B-Rep form | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |
| `Translate` / `Rotate` / `Scale` (uniform) | ✅ baked into inputs | ✅ native SDF ops | ✅ |
| General affine (shear, non-uniform scale) | ✅ box/cylinder/extrude · ❌ others | 🔶 bridged | ✅ / 🔶 |
| `From(BrepSolid)` | ✅ (untransformed) · ❌ transformed | 🔶 bridged (mesh SDF) | ✅ tessellated |
| `From(HalfEdgeMesh)` | ❌ no mesh→B-Rep import | ✅ exact mesh SDF (closed meshes) | ✅ as-is |
| `From(Sdf)` | ❌ no SDF→B-Rep | ✅ native | 🔶 polygonized |

✅ native (exact for the target) · 🔶 bridged through another representation
(approximate but robust; `Explain` names the route) · ❌ impossible — the conversion
throws, with the offending node named.

Everything is convertible **to mesh**: what has no B-Rep form is polygonized from the
SDF path instead (Surface Nets), so `ToMesh`/`Scene.Add` never reject a shape.
`ToMesh` picks the highest-fidelity route per graph: whole-tree B-Rep tessellation
first (crisp edges, exact booleans), SDF polygonization when blends/offsets are
involved, per-node mesh booleans only for `From(mesh)` leaves.

## Dropping down to the engine APIs

`Shape` is a convenience layer, not a cage. When something needs an engine's full API,
exit with `ToBrep()`/`ToImplicit()`/`ToMesh()`, work directly, and re-enter with
`Shape.From(...)` — the wrapped result composes with everything else:

```csharp
// 1. Exit to B-Rep for an operation Shape doesn't surface (rim filleting):
var puck = (Shape.Cylinder(10, 4) - Shape.Cylinder(4, 6)).ToBrep();
var rim = puck.Edges.First(IsTopOuterRim);
var filleted = Filleting.FilletEdge(puck, rim, radius: 1);

// 2. Exit to the SDF AST for a custom field (any hand-written Sdf composes):
Sdf ripple = Sdf.Sphere(6).Offset(0.5 * Math.Sin(...));   // or your own Sdf subclass

// 3. Re-enter and keep modeling representation-agnostically:
var body = Shape.From(filleted)
    .SmoothUnion(Shape.From(ripple).Translate(0, 0, 6), 0.8)
    .Lattice(Sdf.Gyroid(2, 0.4));
scene.Add("hybrid", body);
```

The same works with hand-built `HalfEdgeMesh` geometry (scanned or generated meshes):
`Shape.From(mesh)` is an exact signed distance field to the mesh in implicit lowerings
and participates in mesh booleans directly. The support table above tells you which
exits are lossless for the graph you've built — `Explain(target)` tells you for a
specific shape.

## Quality

Bridges and mesh output honor `MeshQuality` (`SegmentsPerCircle`, `CurveSamples` for
tessellation, `SdfResolution` for polygonization). `Scene.Add(shape)` uses the scene's
`SceneOptions` for the same knobs, and stores the `Shape` itself as `Part.Source`.

## Future work (todo.md)

Exact 2D-profile SDF extrude/revolve nodes (drop the mesh bridge), mesh→B-Rep import
(unlock blends → B-Rep), fillets on `Shape` with edge selectors, ellipsoid surfaces for
non-uniformly scaled spheres.
